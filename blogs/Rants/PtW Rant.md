# Rant Blogs - Pay to Win Games

Have you ever just started a game, and realized "oh wow this seems fun". And for the first few hours, it was fun. And then, as you progress through the game, the need to spend money on it becomes more and more evident. And then just as you were getting good, BAM. You suddenly find out that the game is a Pay to Win game. Dammit. You just wasted so long on a game that you can't even win. Are you triggered now? Probably. Don't play Pay to Win games. You will be triggered.
