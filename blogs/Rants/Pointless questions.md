# Rant Blogs - Pointless questions

So there's always these strange questions being flung around in the 21st century. Most of them are pointless. "Well Roy, you realize that there are no silly and/or stupid questions right?" Guess what? There aren't just silly and stupid questions now, but there are also pointless questions that you can spend your whole life pondering. So before you ask yourself another pointless mind-bending question, here are some that you definitely should not ask yourself. 

## What is the point of life?

Well, I'll tell you the point of life. Live till you die. It's that simple. No, the point is not to be the best of the best,shower in money, it's not to have that 24-million-pack abs (although having 8 or 6 would be great), no, its not about dressing well, impressing everyone, and succeeding, and no, the point of life was certainly not figuring out the answer to "What is the point of life". Lets move on. 

## What came first, the chicken or the egg?

This question, along with basically every other paradox ever, is meant to contradict everything and wonder "what the hell just happened". The point of a question like that is to confuse you. It's just like me saying that this sentence is false. Does you head hurt now? Paradoxes are simply meant to tick you off, or really frustrate you to the point that your brain might explode. So just leave the paradoxes alone, you're better off that way. And to answer your question, the egg came first, assuming we all accept the theory of evolution. The egg that hatched the first "chicken", must have come from a species very much so like the chicken, and with evolution and some mutated genes, voila. You have the first "chicken" egg. And bam. A chicken hatches. 

## Existential Crisis.

Lets not even go there. There really is no point of wondering "hey, why the heck am I even here?". Guess what. You're here. On Earth. At this very moment. Deal with it. You won the race. Get over it. Existential crises are pointless, and should not be dwelled upon.
